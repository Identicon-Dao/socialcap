# Examples repo

This contains different zkApps and other examples used for testing a feature or learning.

**IMPORTANT**

DO NOT INCLUDE ANY GIT REPOS IN THIS FOLDERS OR IN THE ANY OF THE EXAMPLES FOLDER.

Why ? because the main repo is a monorepo containing `docs`, `ui`, `contracts` and `server`, and adding sub repos inside this one is NOT a good/practical idea.

To manage changes to any of this examples or adding new ones, use a features or personal branch and add a pull request to latter merge into `master`.
