# A Community-based Credentials Protocol

## Introduction

Socialcap is ***a community-based credentials protocol that aims to create a transparent and trustworthy process for validating the authenticity of credentials and evidence data***. The protocol enables easy self-validation and issuance of credentials, while preserving privacy and confidentiality.

The Socialcap protocol ***is designed to be community-driven, allowing each community to set its own claim types, credential prices, and validation rules for each claim type***. In this way, the protocol is flexible and can be customized to fit a wide range of use cases.

## Key Aspects of Socialcap

### Social Proof

The Socialcap protocol uses a social proof mechanism to evaluate the importance of a given claim. Fellow members of the same community are selected to act as validators, and typically at least three validators are chosen for each claim. If two out of three votes are honest, the claim is considered validated.

### Anonymity of Validators

To prevent collusion between participants, the validators and auditors evaluating a claim are unknown to the applicant or any other participants in the process. This anonymity ensures that the validation process is fair and unbiased.

### Random Selection 

Socialcap uses a random selection process to assign validators and auditors to each claim. This process ensures that neither applicants, admins, nor other validators know who will be assigned to a given claim, thereby avoiding collusion between participants.

### Secret Voting

To ensure that validators and auditors are protected from any type of pressure or influence from other participants, Socialcap uses a secret voting process. This process ensures that the voting process is fair and unbiased.

### Self-Auditing

Socialcap employs a self-auditing mechanism whereby additional auditors are randomly assigned to cross-check the validators' votes after a certain number of claims. This mechanism is used to collect statistics on validators' behavior and automatically detect and warn on "bad actors" over time.

### Community Rules

The Socialcap protocol allows communities to set their own claim types, credential prices, and validation rules for each claim type. In this way, each community can "own" the protocol for its own use cases.

## Potential use cases

Here are some potential use cases for our protocol:

1. Professional certifications - Socialcap can be used to issue professional certifications for a wide range of industries, such as IT, finance, healthcare, and more. By utilizing the protocol's community-based validation process, these certifications can be more trustworthy and credible.
2. Academic degrees - Socialcap can also be used to issue academic degrees and diplomas, ensuring that the qualifications are legitimate and earned through a transparent process.
3. Volunteer and community work - The protocol can be used to issue credentials for volunteer work, community service, and other forms of social impact. This can incentivize people to get more involved in their local communities and recognize their contributions.
4. Project collaboration - Socialcap can be used to validate and reward individuals who have made significant contributions to a project, such as open-source software development or scientific research.
5. Peer recognition - The protocol can be used to recognize peer accomplishments and achievements within a community, promoting a sense of camaraderie and collaboration.

These are just a few examples, but the Socialcap protocol's flexibility allows it to be applied to a wide range of use cases where trust, transparency, and community participation are valued.

## Conclusion

Socialcap is a community-based credentials protocol that provides a transparent and trustworthy process for validating the authenticity of credentials and evidence data. By using social proof, anonymity, random selection, secret voting, self-auditing, and community rules, Socialcap ensures that the validation process is fair, unbiased, and reliable.
