## Mint the credential on NEAR Protocol USING A BLOCKCHAIN OPERATING SYSTEM (BOS) APP

## Motivation 
Upon successful completion of the claiming validation process, a credential is issued and securely stored on a zkapp (proof of certification) on Mina. While obtaining this proof marks the final step in credential issuance, we also aim to facilitate easy minting of the issued credential on various blockchains. This will be done in the form of a non-transferable NFT, commonly known as Soulbound Tokens (SBT). By implementing such mechanisms, we empower communities and their members to proudly exhibit their social and professional capital within the community, protocol, or blockchain they are associated with.

### Prerequisites to mint a credential on NEAR

1. The user should have to own a NEAR wallet prior minting the credential. 
If the user does not have one, there is multiple ways to create one:
- https://app.mynearwallet.com/
- https://shard.dog/go
- https://vself.app/onboard
- ..

2. The credential mint app uses the SocialCap API to retrieve the credential data that is required to be up and running during the minting process. Follow the steps on the API README
