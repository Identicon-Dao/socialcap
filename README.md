A community based credentials protocol and zkApp on [MINA](https://minaprotocol.com), focused in solving the challenge of verifying the authenticity of credentials in the digital world.

**Why ?**

With the growing importance of credentials in Web3 communities as both a social and professional "signal" (as demonstrated by the popularity of POAPs and other NFTs used to show wealth or belonging), it's crucial to have a streamlined, trusted and reliable system for validating claims.  

Our community-based attestation protocol, complemented by a user-friendly zkApp, enables easy self validation and issuance of credentials using a transparent and repeatable process, while preserving privacy and confidentiality.

Unlike other solutions which mainly store and issue credentials but donâ€™t provide a reliable validation process to authenticate them (relying on third parties or Kleros courts), we focus on establishing a trustable and reliable process for validating the authenticity of the claimed credentials and the provided data.

Our protocol aims to build trust among members, reduce the risk of fraud, and ensure a streamlined, transparent, reliable, and repeatable credential issuing process.
